#VOSH

A project to develop a third-party screenreader for MacOS. Based on [VOSH](https://github.com/FriduxTech/Vosh) by João Santos.

João kickstarted this project in 2024, releasing his sourcodefor a basic screenreader implementation. This was no small undertaking. João's knowledge of Apple's largely undocumented APIs a third-party MacOS screenreader possible, but we have a long way to go.

Voiceover on MacOS is a buggy mess, with bugs dating back 15 years. For a company the with Apple's resources, who claims to care so deeply about accessibility, this is inexcusable. Some bugs do get fixed, occasionally, but there is no clear communication with the user community and the rapid MacOS release updates tend to break more than they fix.

Recent bugs in MacOS 26.1 inspired me to take a look at VOSH, and see if I could move the project forward. I don't claim to be a Swift expert. This code is very much experimental. The repo exists to allow others to contribute to the effort.

Documentation, including keyboard shortcuts and basic usage will follow soon.
